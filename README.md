The data given was about the covid and pollution data around Cleveland based on
specific locations within Cleveland. The first focus of the project was to find out whether
we could produce a valid prediction of the number of cases based on the postal code. I
was doing this for both the covid data from October and November. I also repeated this
process using the pollution data trying to predict the pollution based on the postal code.
The second focus of the problem was to then use multivariable analysis on the individual
data sets to see if I could come up with a conclusive prediction on the amount of covid
cases or the amount of pollution based on multiple variables. My last focus would be to
use the data that Iâ€™ve collected from the two previous problems to create a new dataframe
of the results and see if based on the pollution and covid cases I would be able to predict
what zip code it was most likely associated with and to see if whether the data is good,
and whether the algorithm is accurate and precise.
